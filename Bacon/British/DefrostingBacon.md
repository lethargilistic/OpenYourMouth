# Defrosting Bacon
## Getting bacon quicker

There are three methods that seem to work for this task, but both carry the risk of partially cooking one's bacon. These methods are in no way guaranteed or scientifically tested; proceed with caution, or just leave your bacon in the fridge the night before.

### The microwave method

1. Is the bacon in packaging?
	- (yes) Remove the packaging
	- (no) Continue
2. Place the bacon on a microwavable plate
3. Place the plate (with the bacon on) into the microwave
4. Microwave bacon repeat (4) until defrosted
	- Low power!
	- Short bursts (30 seconds)
	- Check bacon after each cycle
5. Do something with your bacon

### Hot water

1. Is the bacon in packaging?
	- (yes) Remove packaging
	- (no) Continue
2. Heat some water
	- Not to boiling!
3. Put hot water in a bowl
	- Be very careful!
	- Metal bowls conduct the water's heat well and may burn you; they are not advisable.
	- Bowl must be big enough for the bacon to fit
4. Put your bacon in the bowl
	- If the water does not submerge the bacon
		- Ignore if the bacon is floating
		- Top up if the bacon is not floating
			- And it is safe to do so!
				- Not going to cause overflow
5. Leave for 5 minutes repeat (5) until bacon is defrosted
	- Check bacon after each cycle
6. Do something with your bacon

### Defrosting in a Fridge
> The advantages of this method are that you run no risk of cooking your bacon or forgetting it entirely, outside the refrigerator.
> The disadvantage is that it is slow

1. Have foresight
	- You need to start the process one day before you are going to use your bacon
2. Take your bacon out of the freezer
3. Put your bacon into the fridge
4. The next day take the bacon out of the fridge and use it
