## Microwave Brownies

###Tools needed.
* A bowl. (Medium sized.)
* A microwave.

###Mix the dry stuff.
* 65g unsweetened cocoa powder
* 100g plain flour
* 200g sugar

>This can be stored for a while for faster brownies later. 

###Add the rest. 
* 150g butter (melted)
* 2 eggs

>Melt the butter in the microwave, that takes less time. 

###Bake it!
Put your dough in a cup, on a plate, in a shoe. It doesn't matter. 
Cook it for as long as you want, but it finishes FAST. Keep you're eye on it. 
Also, the dough puffs up to about twice the original size when cooked.
